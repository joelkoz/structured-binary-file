structured-binary-file
======================
Classes that read and write binary data to fixed with structured files - the way databases used to be stored on PCs before SQL came around ;)

Files composed of fixed width binary recirds have an advantage in that records can be quickly retrieved based on a
simple calculation.  They are generally smaller than text based storage in that numbers are stored in their binary representation vs character sequences.

This module also contains an implementation of a CircularFile, which builds on FixedRecordFile but limits it to
a maximum number of records.  Once that record limit has been reached, new appends drop the oldest record for
the newer record.  This makes implementing things like rolling logs very simple.

Records in FixedRecordFile and its derivitives are defined using the binary encoder/decoder found in the
project binary-parser-encoder[https://www.npmjs.com/package/binary-parser-encoder].

Here are snipets from the example code (complete code found in the src/examples directory):
```
const FixedRecordFile = require("structured-binary-file").FixedRecordFile;
const Parser = require("binary-parser-encoder").Parser;

let PersonRecord = Parser.start()
                        .uint16("id")
                        .string("firstName", { length: 15, trim: true })
                        .string("lastName", { length: 25, trim: true })
                        .nest("address", { type: Parser.start()
                                                .uint32("number")
                                                .string("street", { length: 25, trim: true })
                                                .string("city", { length: 20, trim: true })
                                                .string("state", { length: 2, trim: true })
                                                .uint32("zip")
                                         });


var file = new FixedRecordFile(PersonRecord);

// Open the file...
file.open("data-fixed-example.dat");

```
